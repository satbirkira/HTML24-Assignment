1. The fonts at low pt are impossible to replicate because photoshop renders them with smoothing anti aliasing. When rendering using strong, photoshop will raise the font height and change the letter spacing and hence the only possible way to come close to the original look is to lower the pt using css to get an approximate look.
2. Put search bar a little higher
3. Realize I did the entire right padding 10px more

looks hard to read. However, it completely throws off the padding.
5. I couldn't get the gradient to only stretch 260px from the left and right of the body.
6. Trying to fix safari rendering
