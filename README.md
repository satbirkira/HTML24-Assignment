HTML24 Job Assignment
============

Introduction
-------
I was given a test where I had three days to re-create the picture below. I had most of the skeleton done in about a day.

Learning Points
-------
I made a ratio calculation error that I didn't notice until later in the assignment. I didn't realize that the 4 sections had their own padding 
(you can tell because the padding matches the section's background). I also didn't take into account that 960px should have been the total width 
of the main container; I used 960px plus 30px padding on both sides. Hence my proportions were wrong. I compensated by changing the container size 
to 1020px, and adding the 30px padding on the individual sections.

Unresolved Issues
-------
The font used in the image was taken from a photoshop psd file. The font was rendered as SMOOTH using photoshop with Garamond, Regular. The problem
with this is that you can't replicate smooth exactly how photoshop does, even when changing the line heights and letter spacings. Hence what the
final product will look like cannot be the same as the image since the font throws off the padding. For example, below is an image of Garamond, Regular
rendered with and without smoothing. You can easily see that using Garamond was a poor choice for this test.
