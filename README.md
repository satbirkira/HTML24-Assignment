HTML24 Job Assignment
============

Introduction
-------
I was given a test where I had three days to re-create the picture below. I had most of the skeleton done in about a day.

Learning Points
-------
I made a ratio calculation error that I didn't notice until later in the assignment. I didn't realize that the 4 sections had their own padding 
(you can tell because the padding matches the section's background). I also didn't take into account that 960px should have been the total width 
of the main container; I used 960px plus 30px padding on both sides. Hence my proportions were wrong. I compensated by changing the container size 
to 1020px, and adding the 30px padding on the individual sections.
